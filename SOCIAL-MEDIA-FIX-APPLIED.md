# 🚀 Quick Test - Social Media Integration

## THE ISSUE WAS FOUND AND FIXED! ✅

**Problem**: The Next.js API route (`frontend/app/api/competitor/analyze/route.ts`) was NOT forwarding the Instagram and Facebook parameters to the backend. It was only passing `yourSite`, `competitorSite`, `email`, and `forceRefresh`.

**Fix Applied**: Updated the API route to extract and forward all social media parameters.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. **No need to restart backend** - The backend code was already correct!

### 2. **Restart Frontend** (Important - to load the fixed API route):
```bash
# In frontend terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 3. **Test the Integration**

Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/competitor

Fill in the form:
```
Your Website: [auto-detected]
Competitor Website: competitor.com

📸 Your Instagram: therock
📸 Competitor Instagram: nike

📘 Your Facebook: EngenSA  
📘 Competitor Facebook: CocaCola
```

Click **"Analyze Competition"**

### On the Webpage:

You should now see **TWO NEW CARDS**:

1. **📸 Instagram Engagement Card**
   - Shows both accounts side by side
   - Followers, engagement rate, interactions
   - Best posting times
   - Winner badge on better performing account

2. **📘 Facebook Page Engagement Card**
   - Shows both Facebook pages
   - Followers, likes, talking about count
   - Rating and reviews
   - Activity level
   - Winner badge on better performing page

---

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

**If you still don't see cards:**

1. ✅ Check browser console (F12) - do you see the debug logs?
2. ✅ Check backend terminal - do you see Instagram/Facebook fetch logs?
3. ✅ Did you restart the frontend? (Important!)
4. ✅ Did you fill in at least one social media username?

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Using @ symbol in Instagram username (just use `therock`, not `@therock`)
- ❌ Using full URL for Facebook (just use `EngenSA`, not `https://facebook.com/EngenSA`)
- ❌ Not restarting frontend after the fix

## 🎯 Test Data That Works

### Instagram Accounts (known to work):
- `therock` - 397M followers
- `nike` - 309M followers
- `cristiano` - 643M followers
- `arianagrande` - 380M followers

### Facebook Pages (known to work):

- `CocaCola` - Large page
- `Nike` - Large page
- `Facebook` - Facebook's own page

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Frontend restarted after fix
- [ ] Filled in social media usernames (without @ symbol)
- [ ] Backend terminal shows Instagram/Facebook fetch logs
- [ ] Browser console shows `showInstagramCard: true`
- [ ] Cards are visible on the page with real data
- [ ] Winner badges showing correctly

## 📝 What Was Changed

**File**: `frontend/app/api/competitor/analyze/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
const { yourSite, competitorSite, email, forceRefresh } = body
// Only these 4 parameters were extracted and forwarded
```

**After**:
```typescript
const { 
  yourSite, competitorSite, email, forceRefresh,
  yourInstagram, competitorInstagram,
  yourFacebook, competitorFacebook 
} = body
// Now all 8 parameters are extracted and forwarded to backend
```

This was the missing piece! The backend was ready, the frontend form was ready, but the API route in the middle was blocking the data from reaching the backend.

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Just restart the frontend and try it now. The cards should appear! 🎉
