# 🔧 Fix Applied - Engagement Metrics Display

## Problem Found
The engagement metrics were showing "0K" because:
1. The function was dividing by 1000 (e.g., 3 → 0.003)
2. Then the display was adding "K" (e.g., 0.003 → "0.003K")
3. Result: "0K" instead of "3"

## Solution Applied
Changed the formatting logic to:
- Numbers < 1000: Show as-is (e.g., "3", "10")
- Numbers ≥ 1000: Show with K (e.g., "1.5K", "27.2K")

## What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
// Function returned: 0.003 (3 divided by 1000)
// Display showed: "0.003K" → rounded to "0K"
```

### After:
```javascript
// Function returns: "3" (formatted string)
// Display shows: "3" (correct!)
```

## Expected Results

Based on your test data:

### Facebook (Agentic Forge)
```
Engagement Score:
├─ Likes: 3          ← Was showing "0K", now shows "3"
├─ Comments: 10      ← Was showing "0K", now shows "10"
├─ Shares: 0         ← Correctly shows "0"
└─ Engagement Rate: (calculated)%
```

### Instagram (@mush_xxf)
```
Engagement Score:
├─ Likes: 0          ← Correctly shows "0"
├─ Comments: 0       ← Correctly shows "0"
├─ Shares: 0         ← Correctly shows "0"
└─ Engagement Rate: 0.0%
```

## How to See the Fix

### Step 1: Save and Refresh
The file has been updated. Just refresh your browser:
```
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Step 2: Check Console
Open browser console (F12) and look for these logs:
```
📊 Received data: {dataAvailable: true, ...}
💬 Engagement Score from API: {likes: 3, comments: 10, shares: 0, ...}
🔢 Calculating network stats from: {likes: 3, comments: 10, ...}
📊 Formatted stats: {likes: "3", comments: "10", shares: "0", ...}
```

### Step 3: Verify Display
You should now see:
- **Likes: 3** (not "0K")
- **Comments: 10** (not "0K")
- **Shares: 0**

## Debug Logs Added

The component now logs:
1. ✅ Raw data received from API
2. ✅ Engagement score values
3. ✅ Calculated network stats
4. ✅ Formatted display values

This helps you see exactly what's happening at each step.

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Numbers (< 1000)
```
API returns: {likes: 3, comments: 10, shares: 0}
Display shows: Likes: 3, Comments: 10, Shares: 0
```

### Scenario 2: Large Numbers (≥ 1000)
```
API returns: {likes: 1500, comments: 300, shares: 50}
Display shows: Likes: 1.5K, Comments: 300, Shares: 50
```

### Scenario 3: Very Large Numbers
```
API returns: {likes: 27200, comments: 3000, shares: 2700}
Display shows: Likes: 27.2K, Comments: 3.0K, Shares: 2.7K
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Open console (F12)
- [ ] Go to Social Media Performance page
- [ ] Select Facebook tab
- [ ] Check engagement score shows: Likes: 3, Comments: 10
- [ ] Check console logs show formatted stats

## Still Not Working?

If you still see "0K":

1. **Check console logs** - Do you see the debug logs?
2. **Check API data** - Does it show `likes: 3, comments: 10`?
3. **Check formatted stats** - Does it show `{likes: "3", comments: "10"}`?
4. **Hard refresh** - Try Ctrl+Shift+R again
5. **Clear all cache** - Or try incognito window
